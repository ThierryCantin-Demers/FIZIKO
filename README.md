# FIZIKO

This project was my team and I's final project for the 4th and final java programming class in CÃ©gep Limoilou's Computer Science and Mathematics program.

It is a simple dart game where the player has to shoot a dart on a dartboard with progressingly more difficult levels. Obstacles are added in later levels and gravity changes.

This project is only in the form of an Eclipse project and uses javafx for the graphical interface.

To run the program, run the the App.java file.
