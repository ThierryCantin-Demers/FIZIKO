# FIZIKO

This project was my team and I's final project for the 4th and final java programming class in Cégep Limoilou's Computer Science and Mathematics program.

It is a simple dart game where the player has to shoot a dart on a dartboard with progressingly more difficult levels. Obstacles are added in later levels and gravity changes. We used Bézier curves to trace the trajectory of the projectile instead of using kinematic equations to calculate it in real time, which was a mistake in hindsight.

This project exists only in the form of an Eclipse project and uses javafx for the graphical interface. It is written in french since it was the school's language of teaching.

To run the program, run the App.java file in Eclipse with a javafx library linked to the project .
